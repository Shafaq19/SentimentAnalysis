# SentimentAnalysis

Sentiment Analysis with an RNN
In this notebook, you'll implement a recurrent neural network that performs sentiment analysis.

Using an RNN rather than a strictly feedforward network is more accurate since we can include information about the sequence of words.

Here we'll use a dataset of movie reviews, accompanied by sentiment labels: positive or negative.
## Installation 
If you are using pip then you can install the required libraries by:

 `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Conda users can make use of the env.yml file to activate

  `conda env create -f env.yml`

   `conda activate env.yml`
